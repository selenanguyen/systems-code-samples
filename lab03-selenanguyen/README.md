# x86-64 Assembly 

> "Nearing Machine Code Representation"

## Introduction/Motivation

Not so long ago, programmers wrote most of their code in assembly. While programmers today primarily use higher level languages (Python, C, etc), it is not uncommon to debug the assembly of your code. These higher level languages afterall typically translate down to an assembly or assembly-like language. 

If you are interested in cybersecurity and reverse engineering, folks more frequently write and analyze assembly code. For high performance applications like [games](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/169946/CC_low_level_curriculum_Looking_at_optimized_assembly.php), programmers may write very optimized code using assembly to get things *just* right. If you are working in hardware or an embededd device, you might also do some assembly programming, as other languages environments are too bulky to support on a small device (though cross-compiling is an option). Even web developers are using something called 'webassembly'. Hmm, the list is getting long here--I think the point is that learning assembly has quite some relevance! Let's dig in and get some practice.

In today's lab you are going to get some practice looking at and writing assembly.

# Part 1 - Assembly - A first program

The first task is to actually just write a 'hello world' in assembly.

- Enter the following text into a file called [hello.s](./hello.s)
- ```asm
	  # Example for x86-64 processor using AT&T Style syntax
	.global _start

	.text

	_start:
		# Write a message to the screen
		mov $1, %rax
		mov $1, %rdi
		mov $message, %rsi
		mov $13, %rdx
		syscall

		# Exit the program
		mov $60, %rax
		xor %rdi, %rdi
		syscall

	message:
		.ascii "Hello, World\n"
  ```
- Save the file and then we will assemble the program using the GNU Assembler (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Assembler)
  - `gcc -c hello.s`
  - This step builds an object file (.o suffix).
  - We now need to create an executable object file using our previously created hello.o file using a tool called *ld*
  - `ld hello.o -o hello`
    - Run `man ld` to learn more.
  - When this has been completed, push hello.s to your repo, and move on!

There are a few interesting things with this program.
1. First, there is a *global* symbol. The global sets up the starting point, as our program needs some entry point. You could think of '_start' as 'main' like in a C program. You can learn more here: http://web.mit.edu/gnu/doc/html/as_7.html#SEC89
2. The next directive (remember, lines that start with a '.' are directives) is .text. These are where our instructions start. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14544068/what-are-data-and-text-in-x86
3. The next few lines are moving some values into registers. The first statement moves the immediate value $1 into register %rax. A few more lines down we see a syscall.
	  1. What is a syscall? In short, it is a call to a function built into the operating system (More here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-introduction-system-call/).
	  2. To figure out which syscall it is, use this resource: https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/
4. Finally at the end there is a label ('message:') with a string literal (.ascii "Hello, World\n"). https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E28388/eoiyg.html

## Aside - Machine Representation of Numbers

  * Note: it may be beneficial to look at this ascii table to see how numbers and letters are represented. https://www.asciitable.com Remember, we do not have a 'text' datatype in assembly. Text instead is represented by numbers shown in the ascii table.

# Godbolt

I **strongly** recommend using the godbolt tool (https://godbolt.org/) to write and experiment with your C programs for this exercise.  The color mappings will help you see what is going on with the generated assembly. You **should** try using both godbolt and your compiler to generate assembly.

Here is an example of the Godbolt tool (and also shows part 4 of this lab)

# Part 2- Compiler Generated Assembly

Let us get some experience reading assembly code generated by the compiler (or godbolt)! It is actually kind of fun, you may learn some new instructions, and at the very least gain some intuition for what code the compiler is generating.

## Compiler generated assembly 1 - Swap

- Write a C program that swaps two integers(in the main body of code).
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap_int.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin swap_int.c -S -o swap_int.s`
- Now modify your program to swap two long's.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap_long.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin swap_long.c -S -o swap_long.s`
- Compare each of the two assembly files using diff. See what changed.
- diff syntax
  - Use: `diff -y swap_int.s swap_long.s`
  
### Response/Observations

*The "movl" commands in swap_int.s became "movq", since the size of the data types changed. Instead of declaring a double world ('l'), or an int in C, we are declaring a quad word ('q'), or a long in C.*

## Compiler generated assembly 2 - Functions

- Write a C program that swaps two integers in a **function** (You may use today's slide as a reference)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  swap.c -S -o swap.s`
- Do the instructions use memory/registers in a different way?

### Response/Observations

*The swap.s file, which has a swap function, uses .LFB0 and .LFE0 to locally label the swap function (FB = function begins, FE = function ends). .cfi_startproc labels the beginning of the function, and .cfi_endproc labels the end of it. The swap_int.s file doesn't have these labels because the swapping logic isn't contained in a separate function.*

## Compiler generated assembly 3 - Static Array
- Write a C program called array.c that has an array of 400 integers in the function of main.
  - Initialize some of the values to something (do not use a loop) (e.g. myArray[0]=72; myArray[70]=56; etc)
  	- Note that it is helpful to use 'weird' numbers so you can see where they jump out.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as array.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin -mno-red-zone array.c -S -o array.s`
- How much are the offsets from the address?

### Response/Observations

*The total offsets (from %rbp) for the addresses for each value in the array are -1600, -1320, -1200, -600, and -100, for array indices 0, 70, 100, 250 375, respectively. Each value in the array is 4 bytes apart in memory (the size of an int).*

## Compiler generated assembly 4 - Dynamic Array 

- Write a C program called array2.c that has an array of 400 integers in the function of main that is dynamically allocated.
  - Initialize some of the values to something (do not use a loop) (e.g. myArray[66]=712; myArray[70]=536; etc)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as array2.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  array2.c -S -o array2.s`
- Study the assembly and think about what is different from the static array.

### Response/Observations

*When calling movl to assign values in the static array, the values are all moved into %rbp registers with offsets. %rbp registers are saved across function calls. With the dynamically allocated array (in array2.s), malloc is called, and the values in the array are moved into %rax registers without offsets.*

## Compiler generated assembly 5 - Goto
The C programming language has a 'goto' command, search how to use it if you have not previously.
(Note that the usage of 'goto' is strongly discouraged in your programs--even mentionining such a keyword may anger programmers due to the difficulty of following many goto statements!)

- Write a C program using the goto command and a label.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as goto.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  goto.c -S -o goto.s`
- Observe what kind of jmp statement is inserted.

### Response/Observations

*The jump statements “jne” and “jmp” are used in goto.s “jmp” means to always jump to a specific piece of code, and “jne” mean to jump if a statement is inequal. In goto.s, test1 compares memory locations %eax and %eax and uses a “jne” statement to jump to .L2 if it is unequal.*

## Compiler generated assembly 6 - For-loops
- Write a C program using a for-loop that counts to 5.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as for.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  for.c -S -o for.s`
- Observe where the code goes for the condition statement (at the start or at the end?).

### Response/Observations

*The code for the condition statement occurs at the end. In .L3, the iterating variable is printed then incremented. In .L2, “cmpl” compares the variable to 5. If it is less than 5, it jumps back to .L2 (the loop).*

## Compiler generated assembly 7 - Switch Statements

- Write a C program using a switch statement (Sample here)[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/switch_statement_in_c.htm].
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as switch.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin switch.c -S -o switch.s`
- See what code a switch statement generates. Is it optimal?

### Response/Observations

*The code for a switch statement is similar to the goto statement. It first defines the strings to be possible printed, and makes the comparisons in the main function. In each case statement, it calls “cmpl” to compare the variable (at memory location %eax) to the value. It then uses a jump statement “je”, to jump to a piece of code (e.g. .L3, where the proper string is printed) if the values were equal (“jump if equal”). The code does the same thing for each case statement, jumping (if equal) to the corresponding pieces of code defined farther down the code.*

## Compiler generated assembly 8 - Add Function

- Write a C program that calls an add function(long add(long a, long b).
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as add.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin add.c -S -o add.s`
- Observe the outputs
- Observe arguments put into registers
- Observe where 'popq' is called.

### Response/Observations

*“popq” is called at the end of the “add” function definition. This is because it must pop off the registers it saved within the function, since the function is now ending.*

# Part 3 - Check your understanding

Provided in Part 3 is an assembly file called [barebones.s](./barebones.s) which contains a minimal assembly program--very similar to part 1. Fill in the questions to make sure you understand all of the parts of an assembly program. Because every instruction in assembly matters, it's important to pay attention to the details of what is going on. I think this is also one of the reasons why assembly programming is fun and very satisfying when things work however!
